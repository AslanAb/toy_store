                <p class="p2">Cibo (SEE-boh) was the head scientist of the Bio-Electric Corporation. Once found and resurrected by Killy, she becomes his sole true ally in his quest to find the Net Terminal Gene.
                <p class="p2">Cibo's appearance changes multiple times throughout the story, as she transfers her consciousness into new bodies or suffers fatal injuries that force her to change her appearance.</p>
                <p class="p2">Centuries before the main storyline, when Cibo still worked as the head scientist at Bio-Electric, she was a tall, slim human woman with short black hair. She wore a black skinsuit with a bulky collar and a utility belt that housed her various tools and instruments.</p>
